Description: Multistate models are considered to perform the analysis of semi-competing 
    risks data. The functions contained in this package will be included in an upcoming 
    release of the SemiCompRisks R package. This package extends the flexibility of 
    frequentist illness-death models by (1) accommodating user-specified weights, 
    permitting the analysis of semi-competing risks data arising from a nested case-
    control study, and (2) parameterizing the baseline hazards using B-splines.
